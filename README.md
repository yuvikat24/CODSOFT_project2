The project involved creating a console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users can play against the computer. Here are some key features and highlights of the project:
get_user_choice(): This function prompts the user to enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). It includes a loop that ensures the user enters a valid choice, handling cases where the input doesn't match the expected options.
get_computer_choice(): Randomly selects the computer's choice using random.choice(["rock", "paper","scissors])
determine_winner(): Determines the winner based on the game rules and returns a message indicating the result (tie, user wins, or user loses)
